Providing full control to set your own responsive image properties for WP 4.4+, the ability to use the &lt;picture&gt; tag and image backgrounds.

== Description ==

The Just Responsive Images plugin gives you control of responsive image properties, which WordPress 4.4+ inserts to all post thumbnails by default.

The default solution is to insert all available image sizes as srcset attribute into img tag. This is not optimal, because the browser gets too much image resolutions, it can generate more requests to the server (to get the right image) and it takes longer to display the image itself. Not to mention, Google Page Speed inspector is not satisfied with such a method.

If you have hand-coded a mobile-friendly HTML/CSS for your theme it usually has media queries for background images and &lt;picture&gt; tags instead of &lt;img&gt; tags. A lot of images are used as block backgrounds very often, which should be editable from CMS. All these best practices are not supported in the WordPress core by default and you end up wasting your time re-writing standard functions.

That's why we're here! We want to provide easy-to-use control for customizing srcset for each image size dimension you use inside your theme. Also we're happy to provide you with a few helpers which will generate tags and generate required media queries for backgrounds.

= Generating image sizes on request =

This plugin DOES NOT register image sizes with WordPress `add_image_size` function. So they are not resized on upload in admin panel. This is done because on big sites there are too much image sizes (especially with enabled retina option) and in this case WordPress wastes the disk space and database with useless files.

Our plugin resize images ONLY when you open the page with an image, printed with rwd functions. Resize is performed through WordPress built in functions, so once resized - WordPress will have information about new sizes available for your image. **Unfortunately it's impact the site speed, when you load the page with images by a first time.** Any good copywriter/administrator checks his content before publishing, so this delay will be seen by admin users in most cases.

= IMPORTANT =

In version 1.2 default RWD set background options updated to mobile-first strategy (from desktop-first).
If you use nested rules from RWD set you should update your main size background option to have @media query with `min-width` rule.

= DEV Mode =

In DEV mode plugin does not resize any images and simply use placeholder images. This can be used to reduce disk space, while you develop and configure our plugin to match all required screen sizes.

To enable it you need to define new constant in your wp-config.php file:

`define( 'JRI_DUMMY_IMAGE', true );`

== Installation ==

1. Download, unzip and upload to your WordPress plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin within you WordPress Administration Backend
3. Add hook `add_filter('rwd_image_sizes', 'my_rwd_image_sizes');`
4. Create new function `my_rwd_image_sizes` and set the configuration array. The example can be found inside the plugin folder in `/data/config-example.php`.

3. Generated HTML.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= Version 1.4 =
By default plugin doesn't require any special requirements through upgrade. 

However if you want to clean up your disk from unused images/image sizes you need to complete several steps:

BEFORE UPGRADE:
- Install plugins [Image Cleanup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-cleanup/) and [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/)
- Backup your Database and `wp-content/uploads` folder!
- Go to Dashboard > Tools > Uploads Cleanup (this page is provided by Just Responsive Images plugin)
- Press "Remove cropped/resized images" - this will clean up your disk from all intermediate image files.
- Now activate "Image Cleanup" plugin and open Dashboard > Tools > Image Cleanup.
- Press "Index Images" button.
- You should see a filter called "Invalid Attachment Meta (XXX)" after indexing, click on it.
- Now select all rows, choose "Delete, Except [Full]" and press "Apply". If you have pagination available - repeat this action for all pages.
- Now you should upgrade Just Responsive Images plugin

AFTER UPGRADE:
- After upgrade the only registered image sizes will be `thumbnail`, `medium` and `large` and your theme specific if there are some. After "Uploads cleanup" we don't have any resized images on disk, so Media library will show missing images.
- To fix missing images in Media Library - use Regenerate Thumbnails plugin.
- Now you can open your site and Just Responsive Images will generate only required sizes.
- We recommend to click through the most important pages of your site to generate required images and do not annoy your visitors with long delay in page load.
